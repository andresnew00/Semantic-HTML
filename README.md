the idea behind this repo is to fully understand the use of the appropiate semantic tags when working on html.
it is important to use this tags if we want to properly communicate the contents of out web application to
Google, Bing or any other browser engine that is trying to read our website, as well as, all other developers
who want to be able to easily read our code.
